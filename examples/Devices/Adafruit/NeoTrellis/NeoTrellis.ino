  * The first is in your keymap definitions. There, you'll use the syntax
  * `M(MACRO_NAME)` to mark a specific keymap position as triggering `MACRO_NAME`

/** The Model 100's key layouts are defined as 'keymaps'. By default, there are three
  * keymaps: The standard QWERTY keymap, the "Function layer" keymap and the "Numpad"
  * keymap.
  *
  * Each keymap is defined as a list using the 'KEYMAP_STACKED' macro, built
  * of first the left hand's layout, followed by the right hand's layout.
  *
  * Keymaps typically consist mostly of `Key_` definitions. There are many, many keys
  * defined as part of the USB HID Keyboard specification. You can find the names
  * (if not yet the explanations) for all the standard `Key_` defintions offered by
  * Kaleidoscope in these files:
  *    https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/src/kaleidoscope/key_defs/keyboard.h
  *    https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/src/kaleidoscope/key_defs/consumerctl.h
  *    https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/src/kaleidoscope/key_defs/sysctl.h
  *    https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/src/kaleidoscope/key_defs/keymaps.h
  *
  * Additional things that should be documented here include
  *   using ___ to let keypresses fall through to the previously active layer
  *   using XXX to mark a keyswitch as 'blocked' on this layer
  *   using ShiftToLayer() and LockLayer() keys to change the active keymap.
  *   keeping NUM and FN consistent and accessible on all layers
  *
  * The PROG key is special, since it is how you indicate to the board that you
  * want to flash the firmware. However, it can be remapped to a regular key.
  * When the keyboard boots, it first looks to see whether the PROG key is held
  * down; if it is, it simply awaits further flashing instructions. If it is
  * not, it continues loading the rest of the firmware and the keyboard
  * functions normally, with whatever binding you have set to PROG. More detail
  * here: https://community.keyboard.io/t/how-the-prog-key-gets-you-into-the-bootloader/506/8
  *
  * The "keymaps" data structure is a list of the keymaps compiled into the firmware.
  * The order of keymaps in the list is important, as the ShiftToLayer(#) and LockLayer(#)
  * macros switch to key layers based on this list.
  *
  *

  * A key defined as 'ShiftToLayer(FUNCTION)' will switch to FUNCTION while held.
  * Similarly, a key defined as 'LockLayer(NUMPAD)' will switch to NUMPAD when tapped.
